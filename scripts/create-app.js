// Getting started
// To create a new app:

// npx @sitevision/create-sitevision-app my-new-app
// npx is a package runner tool (useful when you don't want to pollute global installations)

// The command will create a directory with a basic project structure (you will be prompted to enter if you are creating a WebApp or RESTApp as well as information about your Sitevision environment).

// The project will depend on @sitevision/sitevision-scripts, which gives the project access to utility scripts for building and deployment.

// Version 3.0.0
// You might run in to issues creating a new app if you have an old version of @sitevision/create-sitevision-app installed globally. To fix this, run: npx @sitevision/create-sitevision-app@3 your-app to update to the latest version.
